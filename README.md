This repository hosts a script and build chain meant to produce alternative versions of the Lapwing base dictionary by Aerick.

Currently there is one variant, converted-lapwing-base.json, which replaces the # for proper nouns with the + from the Extended Stenotype plugin.

TODO: `"\+(.*?)(\/.*)?":` to produce a version where # is replaced with duplication of the first stroke instead for compatibility with non-extended steno setups.
